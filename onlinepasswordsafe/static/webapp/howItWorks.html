      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>
        passwd.io does only one thing, but it tries to do it well.
        It allows you to store your confidential data (e.g. passwords,
        online banking credentials, etc.) online in a secure manner,
        but without the need to register, or to download an application.
      </p>
      <p>
        This allows you to have your data with you at all times and
        wherever you are, without any setup steps - as long as you have
        internet access, you will be able to securely access your data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The important thing is that your data is yours, and yours only.
        The information transmitted to the passwd.io servers is already
        encrypted - none of your confidential data is known to us, not
        your passphrase, not your content, not even your mail adress.
      </p>
      <p>
        This works because the passwd.io servers are just a "dumb" data
        store - encryption happens on the client, in your web browser.
        For this, passwd.io uses AES encryption and pbkdf2 hashing,
        two very secure crypto algorithms.
      </p>
      <p>
        You start by entering your mail adress and a passphrase. Both
        are hashed and sent to the server - this way, passwd.io is able
        to authenticate you, without the need to know what your mail adress
        and passphrase actually are. Only the hashes are received by the
        server.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cleartext passphrase is then used to encrypt your confidential
        data on the client - thus, only encrypted data is transferred.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, the passwd.io server knows your hashed mail adress, your hashed
        passphrase, and your encrypted data. This way, we are completely unable
        to decrypt your data, because to do so, the unhashed passphrase is needed,
        which is never sent over the wire.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you access your data, again only the hashes are sent to the servers,
        and are used to find your encrypted data - which is then sent to your browser
        where it is decrypted locally by using your cleartext passphrase.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because no registration is needed, it's possible for someone else to use your
        mail adress for storing data. However, this is not dangerous, because none of
        this data is ever transmitted or stored in the clear. However, it would stop
        you from using your own mail adress, because it's already taken - but there is
        a simple and secure solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        All you need to do is to use the account recovery function - you enter your
        mail adress, which in this single case actually needs to be sent to our servers
        in the clear. We then generate a one-time token for the account that was created
        using your address, and sent this token to your mail adress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because you are the actual, valid owner of this mail adress, only you are able
        to receive the token. You can then use it to completely delete the account and
        data stored for your mail address. You are then able to create a new account
        with your mail address.
      </p>

        What could possibly go wrong? Here is a list:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Someone is eavesdropping your connection, reading the information you sent
            to and receive from the server.
            <br>
            <strong>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
